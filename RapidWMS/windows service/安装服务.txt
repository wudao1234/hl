WinSW Installation Guide
This page provides WinSW installation guidelines for different cases.

Installation steps
In order to setup WinSW, you commonly need to perform the following steps:

Take winsw.exe from the distribution, and rename it to your taste (such as myapp.exe)
Write myapp.xml (see XML Config File specification for more details)
Place those two files side by side, because that's how WinSW discovers its configuration.
Run myapp.exe install <OPTIONS> in order to install the service wrapper.
Optional - Perform additional configuration in the Windows Service Manager.
Optional - Perform extra configurations if required (guidelines are available below).
Declare that the executable is compatible with .NET 4 or above (for WinSW 1.x only)
Enable the WinSW offline mode
Run the service from the Windows Service Manager.
There are some details for each step available below.
